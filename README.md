# Hello, my name is Victor!

## Academic background

I have a degree in **Electrical Engineering** and in 2024 I completed an **MBA in Data Science and Analytics at USP**, which helped expand my knowledge of machine learning techniques and statistical analysis.

## Professional experience

I've been a **data scientist** for two years, working mainly with a focus on modernizing Brazilian industries..

With data analysis, I've already identified compressed air leaks in the order of 70% and thus contributed to reducing costs. I have also analyzed data from oil quality, humidity and vibration sensors in machines and engines.

I was also part of a team that developed a machine learning model to identify the chemical composition of scrap metal for steel production. As a result, the client reduced its consumption of more expensive scrap and thus cut costs both in the purchase of material and in the production of steel.

My work and study routine involves the use of **Python** and libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, SKlearn, Scipy, Matplotlib and Plotly.
I have already developed models such as supervised bagging techniques with random forest and gradient boosting with XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM and AdaBoost for both classification and regression problems.
In addition, modeling involves the use of hyper parameters, analysis of overfitting, underfitting, cross-validation and metrics.
I also coded with R during my MBA.
