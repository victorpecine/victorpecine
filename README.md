# Welcome to my GitHub

I'm Victor,

And my goal as **Data Scientist** is to help companies become data-driven and use data to make strategic decisions, increase profits and optimize processes.

## About me

+2 years' experience as a Data Scientist developing clustering, classification and regression machine learning models to contribute to the modernization of Brazilian industries.

I also carried out statistical studies and optimization on the models, proposing improvements to increase efficiency with programming in SQL and Python.

In addition, I have interacted with clients to understand their needs and ensure the delivery of value to help teams and leaders make decisions.

To do this, I seek a business vision to understand the need and align solutions with organizational strategies.

My daily work and study routine involve using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

I have developed models using models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and AdaBoost.

Furthermore, the modeling process includes the use of hyperparameters, analysis of overfitting and underfitting, cross-validation, and metrics evaluation.


## Education

-   MBA in Data Science and Analytics - USP (2022 - 2024)

-   Postgraduate in Renewable Energies and Energy Efficiency - UFPR (2018 - 2020)

-   Bachelor of Electrical Engineering - UTFPR (2009 - 2017)


## Past experiences

### Data Scientist at Ubirat√£

From Jan. 2024 to Aug. 2024 - 7 months

-   I took part in a project where we developed a supervised machine learning model using non-negative least squares regression.

-   The aim was to estimate the percentage of chemical elements in the scrap used in steel production.

-   With the implementation of the model, the client obtained monthly savings of thousands of dollars.

-   My responsibilities included statistical analysis, drawing up graphs for presentations to clients, searching for and manipulating data in PostgreSQL, using the Scipy, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Plotly libraries and taking part in meetings in English with clients.


### Data Scientist at PredData

From Oct. 2022 to Jan. 2024 - 15 months

-   I was responsible for starting the company's data science department.

-   I developed unsupervised machine learning algorithms for clustering and supervised algorithms for classification to identify compressed air leaks.

-   We identified leaks over 60% for a multinational vehicle manufacturer.

-   I also created dashboards for clients to view compressed air consumption and analyze estimated losses in real time.
